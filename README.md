mahout-mongodb-integration
==========================

This is a integration project between [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org) and [Mongodb](http://mongodb.org). The objective of this project is to build a machine learning system using Mahout as the data mining framework and Mongodb as the datastore. It uses Spring-Data-Mongodb for Mapreduce, and use Mahout for the Map to convert from Mongodb's data to recommendations.

This is still work in progress, visit back in next few days. For more information on Spring and other stuff visit my [website](http://krishnasblog.com).
